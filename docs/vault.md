# Vault Integration

## Problem

terok bind-mounts vendor config directories into task containers. A
prompt-injected or supply-chain-compromised agent can read and exfiltrate
API keys, OAuth tokens, or SSH private keys from these shared mounts.

## Solution: Token Broker

No real secret enters a task container. Instead:

1. **Credential DB** (host-side) stores API keys and OAuth tokens
2. **Token broker** ([terok-sandbox](https://terok-ai.github.io/terok-sandbox/))
   resolves phantom tokens to real credentials and forwards requests upstream.
   It runs inside each container's supervisor (spawned by the terok-sandbox
   OCI hook) and listens on a Unix socket (default) or a per-container host
   TCP port (legacy)
3. **Per-provider phantom tokens** (per-task, per-provider) are what containers see
4. **SSH signer** ([terok-sandbox](https://terok-ai.github.io/terok-sandbox/))
   lets containers sign with host-side SSH keys without the private keys
   entering the container — via the bind-mounted signer socket
   (`TEROK_SSH_SIGNER_SOCKET`) or, in TCP mode, a per-container port
   (`TEROK_SSH_SIGNER_PORT`)

## Architecture

```

### SELinux considerations

SELinux blocks `connect()` on host Unix sockets mounted into rootless
Podman containers (`container_t -> unconfined_t` denied).  terok-sandbox
ships a policy module (`terok_socket.te`, installed by `setup`) that
allows exactly this connect.  Where the module cannot be installed, the
containers reach the token broker via TCP
(`host.containers.internal:<port>`) instead; [terok-shield](https://terok-ai.github.io/terok-shield/)
allows the broker port through the nftables firewall via its per-container
`loopback_ports` state.

### Per-provider phantom token routing

Each routed provider gets its own phantom token, minted at container
launch:

```python
tokens = {name: db.create_token(scope, task_id, credential_set, name) for name in routed_providers}
```

The token broker resolves the route from the token's `provider` field, not from
the URL path. This is essential because some SDKs (Vibe's Mistral SDK,
gh CLI) strip or ignore URL path components.

## Per-Agent Traffic Routing

Inside the container, HTTP clients always reach the vault at
`http://localhost:9419` — an in-container loopback bridge that runs in
both transports and forwards to the host socket (socket mode) or the
per-container broker port (TCP mode).  Different agents are pointed at
it in different ways, depending on what their SDK supports:

| Agent | How it reaches the token broker | Notes |
|-------|-------------------------|-------|
| **Claude** | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:9419` (+ `ANTHROPIC_UNIX_SOCKET` pointing at the vault socket) | Anthropic SDK respects these env vars |
| **Codex** | Shared `~/.codex/config.toml` rewrite (`openai_base_url`, `chatgpt_base_url`) | Codex's built-in first-party auth is file/config based, so terok patches the shared Codex config instead of relying on env vars.  `openai_base_url` is keyed by stored credential type: OAuth → `{{ vault_tls_url }}/backend-api/codex`, API key → `{{ vault_url }}/v1`.  `chatgpt_base_url` is `{{ vault_tls_url }}/backend-api/` |
| **Vibe** | `config.toml` with `api_base` (+ `api_key_env_var`) in shared `~/.vibe` mount | Mistral SDK ignores the URL path in api_base, only uses host:port. Written by the `provider.config_patch` in YAML |
| **OpenCode / Pi** | Generic `TEROK_PROVIDER_<NAME>_*` variables | Terok creates a phantom token, a vault base URL, a label, and model data for each authenticated provider. The provider must support the agent protocol. Use `--provider <name>` to select the provider. Legacy aliases also keep their `TEROK_OC_<NAME>_*` settings. |
| **gh** | `http_unix_socket` in `~/.config/gh/config.yml` | gh routes ALL API traffic through a Unix socket. See below. |
| **glab** | `GITLAB_API_HOST` + `API_PROTOCOL=http` env vars | glab sends to `http://<api_host>/api/v4/...`; the host is `localhost:9419` in socket mode, `host.containers.internal:<port>` in TCP mode |
| **CodeRabbit** | Real API key via sidecar `env_map` | CLI has no base URL override, so token broker routing is not possible. The sidecar receives the real key directly from the credential DB. |
| **SonarCloud** | `SONAR_HOST_URL` + `SONAR_TOKEN` phantom env | Tool; scanner uses the host URL override |

In addition, every routed provider with a `serves:` protocol map is
materialized as a generic handle — `TEROK_PROVIDER_<NAME>_TOKEN` plus
`TEROK_PROVIDER_<NAME>_BASE_<PROTOCOL>` — so harnesses (OpenCode, Pi)
can select any authenticated, protocol-compatible provider at runtime
via `--provider`.

### gh: Unix-socket pattern

gh has no env var for base URL. It supports `http_unix_socket` in its
config file, which routes all API traffic through a Unix socket.

The config-patch mechanism writes the vault socket path into
`~/.config/gh/config.yml` after `terok-executor auth gh` — the
`{{ vault_socket }}` template token, resolved per transport mode:

- **socket mode**: `/run/terok/vault/vault.sock` — the supervisor's vault
  socket, exposed through the read-only runtime-tree mount.
- **TCP mode**: `/tmp/terok-vault.sock` — a socat bridge started by
  terok-sandbox's `ensure-bridges.sh`, forwarding to
  `host.containers.internal:${TEROK_TOKEN_BROKER_PORT}`.

Either way gh's API traffic reaches the vault token broker, which
substitutes the phantom token before forwarding upstream.

### Codex: the TLS bridge

Codex refuses a ChatGPT backend URL that is not `https`, and sends its
model requests to that backend's origin.  terok-sandbox's
`ensure-bridges.sh` therefore puts a TLS bridge in front of the loopback,
on `LOOPBACK_VAULT_TLS_PORT`, whenever `TEROK_VAULT_TLS_PORT` is set.  The
executor sets it only when a routed provider binding declares `ca_cert_env`,
so a task without Codex has no bridge, and only Codex images install the
`openssl` that makes the certificate.  The `{{ vault_tls_url }}` template
token names it.

The bridge's certificate is a self-signed `localhost` leaf, made in the
container on first use and never leaving it.  It lives as long as the
container, so there is nothing to sync with the host or rotate.  Only
Codex trusts it: `ca_cert_env: CODEX_CA_CERTIFICATE` hands Codex the
certificate path as an extra trust root, and the container's trust store
stays untouched.  The TLS adds no protection — both ends are the
container — it only satisfies Codex.

```yaml
# resources/agents/codex.yaml
provider:
  ca_cert_env: CODEX_CA_CERTIFICATE   # Codex's extra trust root: the bridge's certificate
  config_patch:
    file: config.toml
    toml_set:
      chatgpt_base_url: "{{ vault_tls_url }}/backend-api/"
```

### YAML-driven config patches

Agents that need config file changes (not just env vars) declare a
`config_patch` under their `provider:` binding:

```yaml
# Vibe: TOML patch
provider:
  config_patch:
    file: config.toml
    toml_table: providers
    toml_match: {name: mistral}
    toml_set:
      api_base: "{{ vault_url }}/v1"
      api_key_env_var: MISTRAL_API_KEY

# gh: YAML patch
provider:
  config_patch:
    file: config.yml
    yaml_set: {http_unix_socket: "{{ vault_socket }}"}
```

The patch is applied after auth and reconciled on every task launch.  Only
non-secret values (URLs, socket paths) are written to shared mounts.  The
patcher also writes a `.terok-managed-config.json` sidecar beside the config
file so callers can later disable a provider and remove only values still
owned by terok; user-edited values are preserved.

## YAML Registry: Providers and Bindings

Vault integration is split across two YAML files.  The **endpoint**
half lives in `resources/providers/<name>.yaml` — where requests go
and how the real credential is attached:

```yaml
# resources/providers/anthropic.yaml
upstream: https://api.anthropic.com
auth:                            # wire auth per credential type
  oauth:
    header: Authorization
    prefix: "Bearer "
    extra_headers: {anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20}
  api_key:
    header: x-api-key
    prefix: ""
oauth_refresh: {token_url: ..., client_id: ...}   # optional
serves:                          # protocol → served path (harness selection)
  anthropic-messages: ""
```

Define a user provider in `~/.config/terok/providers/<name>.yaml`. Use the same
schema as the bundled providers. For a typical OpenAI-compatible API,
`auth: {api_key: {}}` selects the `Authorization: Bearer` format. Add a
`serves:` entry to make the provider available to OpenCode and Pi. When the
`models:` map is present, OpenCode and Pi do not request `/models`.

See [Custom providers](agents.md#custom-providers) for a minimal example. Terok
also reads the legacy directory `~/.config/terok/agent/providers/` and the
legacy `opencode:` fields. Terok loads the current provider directory last.
Thus, a current file overrides a legacy file that has the same name.

The **delivery** half is the agent's `provider:` binding in
`resources/agents/<name>.yaml`:

```yaml
# resources/agents/claude.yaml
provider:
  default: anthropic             # binds the agent to one provider
  token_env:                     # phantom-token env var, keyed by credential type
    oauth: CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN
    _default: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY  # fallback for any non-OAuth credential
  base_url_env: ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL   # optional: env var for the vault URL
  socket_env: ANTHROPIC_UNIX_SOCKET  # optional: env var for the vault socket
  credential_file: .credentials.json
  credential_type: oauth
  config_patch: ...              # optional: file patch for the vault address
```

A provider maps to exactly one vault route. The roster loader rejects a
provider that is bound to more than one agent. `routes.json` contains one entry
for each provider. The provider name is the entry key. Thus, OpenCode or Pi can
use a provider that is not bound to an agent.

After successful authentication, Terok updates `routes.json`. Terok updates the
file again before it creates phantom tokens for a task. The `setup` command and
the `terok-executor vault routes` command also update the file.

### Agent-specific settings not in YAML

- **OpenCode base URL override**: For Blablador, KISSKI, OpenRouter, and
  Opper, the environment builder sets `TEROK_OC_<NAME>_BASE_URL` when the
  vault is active. This is computed at container launch, not declared in YAML.

- **glab env vars**: `GITLAB_API_HOST` and `API_PROTOCOL=http` are injected
  by the environment builder for glab specifically. glab has no YAML field
  for this because it's a routing concern, not a credential concern.

- **socat bridges**: terok-sandbox's `ensure-bridges.sh` runs in-container.
  In socket mode the broker socket is exposed at
  `/run/terok/vault/vault.sock` through the read-only runtime-tree mount,
  and the bridge fronts it as TCP on
  `localhost:9419` for HTTP-only clients.  In TCP mode the bridge is
  reversed: it presents `/tmp/terok-vault.sock` for socket-only clients
  and forwards `localhost:9419` to the per-container host port.

## Auth Flow

### Three auth paths

**1. OAuth / interactive login** (Claude, Codex, gh):
Launches a container with the vendor CLI and a temporary config
directory.  After exit, the extractor captures the OAuth token to the
DB.  Codex additionally offers a headless device-code variant
(`--device-auth`).

**2. API key -- interactive prompt** (Vibe, Blablador, KISSKI, OpenRouter,
Opper, custom API-key providers, glab, CodeRabbit, SonarCloud): Terok asks for
an API key in the terminal. You do not need a container.

**3. API key -- non-interactive** (any provider with an auth flow):
`terok-executor auth <provider> --api-key <key>`

Credentials are stored keyed by the entry's *provider* (`claude` →
`anthropic`, `gh` → `github`), matching the vault route names.

After successful API-key or OAuth authentication, Terok updates `routes.json`.
The next task can use the new provider without another command. At task start,
Terok updates the file again to include provider-file changes.

### Post-auth config patching

After storing credentials, `write_vault_config()` applies any
`provider.config_patch` from the YAML registry. This writes vault
addresses (not secrets) to the entry's shared config mount.  Task launch
re-applies enabled patches and removes disabled provider patches using
the managed sidecar (`.terok-managed-config.json`), which keeps global
shared config directories from retaining stale vault routing after a
feature mode changes.

## Per-Provider Credential Extractors

| Entry      | File                | Key fields                    |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Claude     | `.credentials.json` (fallback: `config.json`) | access_token, refresh_token (fallback: api_key) |
| Codex      | `auth.json`         | access_token, refresh_token, id_token, account_id |
| Vibe       | `.env`              | key (MISTRAL_API_KEY)         |
| Blablador  | `config.json`       | key (api_key)                 |
| KISSKI     | `config.json`       | key (api_key)                 |
| gh         | `hosts.yml`         | token (oauth_token)           |
| glab       | `config.yml`        | token (per-host)              |
| OpenRouter | —                   | API key via prompt/`--api-key` |
| Opper      | `config.json`       | key (api_key)                 |
| CodeRabbit | —                   | API key via prompt/`--api-key` |
| SonarCloud | —                   | API key via prompt/`--api-key` |

## Limitations

- **Claude**: OAuth logins do not support full routing. You can either expose the
  real token to the agent to get the full Claude CLI user experience, or route
  what's officially routable, but miss out on some subscription features.
- **Codex**: ChatGPT/backend-api and realtime websocket traffic are routed
  through the token broker, but any newly added Codex-specific upstream
  surfaces still need explicit vault route coverage.
- **Copilot**: Not proxied yet — no `provider:` binding in its YAML, so no
  vault route and no `auth` flow.

## Package Boundaries

- **[terok-sandbox](https://terok-ai.github.io/terok-sandbox/)**: Credential
  DB, token broker (HTTP/WebSocket forwarding, phantom token resolution,
  OAuth token refresh, SSH signer), socket/TCP listeners, per-container
  supervisor lifecycle
- **terok-executor** (this package): YAML agent + provider registry,
  credential extractors, auth CLI, canonical container environment assembly
  (phantom env vars, base URL overrides, config patches)
- **[terok](https://terok-ai.github.io/terok/)**: Multi-task orchestration on
  top — delegates env assembly here and layers per-project credential sets
  and OAuth exposure tiers
