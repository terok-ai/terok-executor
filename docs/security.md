# Security

terok-executor isolates each agent behind four layers: an egress firewall,
a vault, optional restricted mode, and rootless containers.

## Egress firewall

On by default for every container that starts through terok-executor.
The firewall ([terok-shield](https://terok-ai.github.io/terok-shield/))
restricts outbound traffic to explicitly allowed domains — the agent's
API endpoint, package registries, and git hosts.  Everything else is
blocked at the nftables level.

The firewall is attached via OCI hooks at install time (``terok-executor
setup`` / ``terok-sandbox setup``); ``run`` has no per-run opt-out flag.
To loosen it for development, use the live shield verbs — per container:
``terok-executor sandbox shield allow|deny|down|up`` — or remove the
hooks entirely with ``terok-executor sandbox shield uninstall-hooks``.

The git gate mirror (``--gate`` / ``--no-gate``) is a separate concern
from the firewall — see [Launch modes](launch-modes.md) for that flag.

## Vault

No real API keys, OAuth tokens, or SSH private keys enter containers.
Instead, each container receives per-task **phantom tokens**. A host-side
token broker ([terok-sandbox](https://terok-ai.github.io/terok-sandbox/))
resolves phantom tokens to real credentials and forwards requests
upstream over TLS.

SSH keys are handled the same way: a host-side SSH signer lets
containers sign git operations without the private key crossing the
container boundary.

This means a compromised agent cannot read, copy, or exfiltrate real
credentials — they exist only on the host and are never written to
container-accessible mounts.

See [Vault internals](vault.md) for the full
architecture, per-agent routing table, and YAML configuration.

### Managing the vault

The vault is served per container: the supervisor spawns on container
start via the terok-sandbox OCI hook and reads the per-container
sidecar to bind its proxy.  The vault verbs are DB inspection and
passphrase-tier management (owned by terok-sandbox) plus two
executor-only file-level helpers:

```bash
terok-executor vault status      # lock state, passphrase chain, stored secrets
terok-executor vault unlock      # provision the credential-DB passphrase for this session
terok-executor vault lock        # clear every stored copy of the passphrase
terok-executor vault list        # inventory stored credentials
terok-executor vault passphrase  # manage passphrase storage (seal, to-desktop-keyring, …)
terok-executor vault routes      # regenerate routes.json from the YAML roster
terok-executor vault clean       # remove leaked credential files from mounts
```

## Restricted mode

```bash
terok-executor run claude . --restricted -p "…"
```

Disables auto-approve flags and sets `--no-new-privileges` on the
container. Use for untrusted prompts or when the agent should confirm
every action with the user.

## Rootless containers

All containers run under rootless Podman — no daemon, no root privileges.
Combined with SELinux labeling, this limits what a compromised agent can
reach on the host filesystem.
