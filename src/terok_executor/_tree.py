"""Composes executor's full [`CommandTree`][terok_sandbox.commands.CommandTree].

Lives below the CLI surface so the package init can re-export the
composed tree as ``terok_executor.COMMANDS`` (the cli module is at
the top of the dependency graph; nothing below it may import it).

Three views over one underlying ``SANDBOX_TREE`` instance:

- ``terok-executor <own-verb>``        — executor's verbs (run, auth, …)
- ``terok-executor sandbox <verb>``    — full sandbox tree, deep path
- ``terok-executor vault <verb>``      — shortcut sharing identity with
  the corresponding subtree under ``sandbox``
