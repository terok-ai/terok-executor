"""Krun (KVM-microVM) host-side provisioning: identity + runtime factory.

Two responsibilities, both intentionally outside terok:

- [`ensure_krun_host_keypair`][terok_executor.krun.ensure_krun_host_keypair]
  — mint or load the SSH keypair the L0 guest's ``sshd`` trusts, and
  materialise both halves onto tmpfs files: the private half so
  ``ssh -i`` can read it, and the public half so the orchestrator can
  bind-mount it into the running guest at
  ``/etc/ssh/authorized_keys.d/terok``.  The vault is the system of
  record; the tmpfs cache is a derived view rebuilt per process.

- [`make_krun_runtime`][terok_executor.krun.make_krun_runtime] — one-shot
  constructor for a production
  [`KrunRuntime`][terok_sandbox.KrunRuntime] backed by the TCP-over-passt
  SSH transport, with the keypair already wired in.  terok flips its
  runtime selector to ``krun`` and calls this; everything else is
  invisible.

Living in executor (rather than terok) keeps the rule honest: anything
that owns the L0 build path also owns the trust material that makes
the resulting guest reachable.  Selecting krun without provisioning
the key is a contradiction, so the two operations belong together.

    The vault is the system of record: the keypair lives in the sandbox

    [`ensure_infra_keypair`][terok_sandbox.ensure_infra_keypair] (which

    The orchestrator bind-mounts ``public_path`` into the running

    Rotation = clear the ``%host`` scope in the vault, then re-run.
    Typically called per task launch under krun (idempotent — loads
    on subsequent calls).  New tasks pick up the new key; in-flight
    tasks keep what they had until they're stopped.

    Requires the vault to be unlocked — the krun runtime is gated on
    ``experimental: true`` upstream and assumes the operator has the

      the in-guest sshd can start, listen on TCP 22, and drop to the
      authenticated user on connection.  ``USER dev`` is the right
      default under crun (AI agents that refuse uid 0); under krun the
      session uid comes from which ``ssh user@…`` the operator picks.
    - ``--dns 169.254.1.1`` — kept for shield-bypass; under shield-up
