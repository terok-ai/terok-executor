"""Patches provider config files to route API traffic through the vault.

Applies ``shared_config_patch`` from the YAML roster after authentication
and — crucially — on every task start.  Writes vault URLs / socket paths
(not secrets) to provider config files so agents route traffic through the
vault instead of hitting upstream directly with phantom tokens.

Two template tokens are substituted into patch values:

- ``{vault_url}``    — HTTP URL the container should reach the vault on.
- ``{vault_socket}`` — filesystem path of a Unix socket the container can
  connect to for the vault.

The concrete values are mode-dependent (socket vs TCP transport) and
resolved centrally — agent YAMLs only need to reference the tokens.
