"""Executor-level vault helpers: route generation + credential-leak scan.

The vault is served per container: the supervisor spawns on container
start via the terok-sandbox OCI hook and reads the per-container
sidecar to bind its proxy.  Sandbox owns the ``unlock`` / ``lock`` /
``passphrase`` verbs (passphrase-tier CRUD on the DB).

What lives here:

- ``routes`` — regenerate ``routes.json`` from the YAML agent roster.
- ``clean`` — remove leaked credential files from shared config mounts.
- ``scan_leaked_credentials`` + the ``_BENIGN_CREDENTIAL_CHECKS``
  registry of per-provider recognizers for credential files that are
  legitimately non-empty — primitives the scan + clean verbs share.

Both verbs operate on host-side files only.
