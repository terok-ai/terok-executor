"""Model-roster probe for in-container ACP agents.

Each in-container agent ships an ACP wrapper script (``terok-{agent}-acp``)
that exposes the agent over JSON-RPC on stdio.  To learn which models an
agent currently advertises, we drive a minimal handshake:

1. ``initialize`` — version negotiation
2. ``session/new`` — receive ``configOptions`` (the model list lives here)
3. close stdin — agent exits cleanly

The handshake is cheap (a few round-trips) but non-trivial to repeat:
the result is cached by [`AgentRosterCache`][terok_executor.acp.cache.AgentRosterCache]
and reused for the lifetime of the authenticated session.

The probe is transport-agnostic on top of
[`exec_stdio`][terok_sandbox.ContainerRuntime.exec_stdio] — it owns no FDs of its
own; it spawns the agent in an executor thread and bridges the two ends
of a pipe pair as asyncio [`StreamReader`][asyncio.StreamReader]/[`StreamWriter`][asyncio.StreamWriter]
so the proxy loop can drive them naturally and cancel cleanly.
