"""Per-task ACP roster: aggregates in-container agents into one endpoint.

[`ACPRoster`][terok_executor.acp.roster.ACPRoster] owns the per-task state for the ACP host-proxy:

- the cache lookup that answers "what models does this agent advertise?"
- the live walk that answers "what agents are currently authenticated for
  this image?" — re-evaluated on every ``session/new`` so newly-authed
  agents appear without daemon restart
- the proxy attach loop (delegated to [`proxy`][terok_executor.acp.proxy]) that brokers JSON-RPC
  frames between the connected client and the chosen backend

The class follows the shape of
[`AgentRunner`][terok_executor.container.runner.AgentRunner]: lazy-init
properties for cross-cutting subsystems, OOP over free functions, no
mutable state in ``__init__`` beyond the parameters themselves.
