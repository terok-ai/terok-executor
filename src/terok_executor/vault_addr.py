"""Container-side vault addressing — single source of truth.

Two transports reach the vault from inside a task container:

- **Socket mode** (default, preferred): the host's vault socket is
  bind-mounted into the container at [`CONTAINER_VAULT_SOCKET`][terok_executor.vault_addr.CONTAINER_VAULT_SOCKET].
  Clients that can speak HTTP-over-UNIX (``gh``, ``claude``) connect
  directly; everyone else goes through an in-container socat bridge that
  exposes the vault as plain TCP on ``localhost:LOOPBACK_VAULT_PORT``.

- **TCP mode** (legacy): the vault's token broker listens on a host TCP
  port (``host.containers.internal:<broker_port>``).  Socket-only
  clients reach it via a local socat bridge that presents a Unix socket
  at [`LOOPBACK_BRIDGE_SOCKET`][terok_executor.vault_addr.LOOPBACK_BRIDGE_SOCKET].

These paths and port numbers have to agree across the python builders,
the shell bridge script, and the doctor probes — define them here so
every layer imports the same value.
