"""Regression for #86 — ``scan_leaked_credentials`` warns when it skips a provider.

The scan used to ``except (OSError, TypeError): continue`` silently, so
an operator running it on a not-yet-mounted shared dir would see an
empty result and conclude "no leaks found" — when in fact zero
providers had been checked.  The fix surfaces a per-provider warning
on stderr while keeping the loop going so other providers still get
scanned.
